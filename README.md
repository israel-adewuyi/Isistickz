I'm a first year student at [Innopolis University](https://innopolis.university/). I'm passionate about buiding things. 

**Here's a quick summary about me**:

- 💡 Fun fact: My favourite Netflix show is Black Mirror because it sparks thoughts about how technology changes our lives, yet, I think technology is also the best humanity can do. So is Black Mirror an eventuality????? :)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ML, Mathematics and working on ML related projects.
- 😊 I’m looking for help with open source projects, hackathons, internships, and entry-level opportunities.
